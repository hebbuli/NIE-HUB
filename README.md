DBMS Django Project 

This project aims at developing a user friendly software platform for easy access of information and material to the teachers and students. Dissemination of information through this modality is efficient in terms of time, effort and convenience.   
The database keeps track of the various data required. 
This project is divided into the following sections: 

Login module: There is a page for the user to sign up for the application either as a teacher or as a student. This module authenticates the user to login to their respective profile using their login ids and password.  
 
Posts/Information Section: In this section, teachers can upload study materials along with other information pertaining to students using this web interface denoting the semester and branch of the of the target students. These posts or announcements can be viewed by the students belonging to that semester and branch by logging into the website through their credentials. 
 
Events Section: In this section, event organizers can post the events and the information about the events such as the information pertaining to the items being sold. After the event is posted, the users can then view the events going on and also book the merchandise sold by the event organizer. This can be sold offline, by mutual communication between the organizer and the buyer through phone call. 
 
Books Section:  In this section, students can post the books they want to sell quoting the price they want to sell it for and all the necessary details regarding the book. Other students who want to buy the book can search for the book in the books section and reserve them. The seller will then see the request for the book and the books can be sold offline through mutual communication between the seller and the buyer through a phone call.
